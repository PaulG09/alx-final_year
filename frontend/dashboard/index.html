                            while challenging, provide opportunities for impactful intervention. Through data-driven
                            approaches, we can better understand disease trends, identify risk factors, and create

                                <p>In Ghana, diseases like malaria, tuberculosis, hypertension, diabetes, and cervical
                                    cancer continue to impact the population, with statistics revealing disturbing
                                    trends. The malaria incidence remains one of the highest in sub-Saharan Africa, with
                                    over 5 million cases annually. Hypertension is on the rise, affecting more than 25%
                                    of the adult population, and diabetes prevalence has increased significantly, driven
                                    largely by changing lifestyles.</p>
                                <p>Despite significant efforts in controlling tuberculosis, it continues to be one of
                                    the most common infectious diseases, causing thousands of deaths each year.
                                    Meanwhile, cervical cancer, largely preventable through screening and vaccination,
                                    still claims the lives of many women in Ghana, particularly in rural areas. Public
                                    health data analytics is crucial in tracking the spread and impact of these
                                    diseases, allowing for more focused interventions.</p>

                                <p>According to recent health data, the rates of HIV/AIDS and maternal deaths have also
                                    been a cause for concern, although significant progress has been made with treatment
                                    and care access. Statistics show that over 200,000 individuals are currently living
                                    with HIV/AIDS in Ghana, with the majority being unaware of their status. Maternal
                                    mortality, while declining, remains a critical issue, particularly in rural and
                                    underserved communities.</p>
                                <p>Data analytics is not only essential for monitoring these diseases but also for
                                    understanding their broader societal impacts. By analyzing disease trends,
                                    healthcare providers and policymakers can make informed decisions, allocate
                                    resources more efficiently, and design interventions that target high-risk
                                    populations.</p>
